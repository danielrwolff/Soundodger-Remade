# Soundodger-Remade
Grade 12 Culminating Project - written in Java/Processing

This is the game Soundodger remade by myself for my grade 12 Computer Science culminating project (2014-2015).
The original game can be found here: http://games.adultswim.com/soundodger-puzzle-online-game.html

This project was made using Processing 2.2.1.
The download for processing can be found here: https://processing.org/download/?processing
Note: The project should still work on Processing 3.0.

This project can be run in Java mode or Javascript mode.
